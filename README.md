A collection of hands-on labs and practice projects using Terraform to provision and manage cloud infrastructure. 
This repository is intended as both a learning space and a reference library for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) patterns.

# Goals

Practice Terraform fundamentals (providers, resources, variables, outputs).

Build and test cloud infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Explore modules, state management, and remote backends.

Experiment with CI/CD automation for Terraform using GitHub Actions / GitLab CI.
